# aws-marketplace-evaluation

## Synopsis

The
[aws-marketplace-evaluation](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation)
AWS Cloudformation template creates an AWS VPC
and Aurora Postgres serverless database deployment.
The Cloudformation does not deploy Senzing.
Rather, it deploys a database than can be used by other AWS Cloudformations
which do deploy Senzing such as
[aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic).

## Preamble

At [Senzing](http://senzing.com),
we strive to create GitHub documentation in a
"[don't make me think](https://github.com/Senzing/knowledge-base/blob/master/WHATIS/dont-make-me-think.md)" style.
For the most part, instructions are copy and paste.
Whenever thinking is needed, it's marked with a "thinking" icon :thinking:.
Whenever customization is needed, it's marked with a "pencil" icon :pencil2:.
If the instructions are not clear, please let us know by opening a new
[Documentation issue](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation/issues/new?template=documentation_request.md)
describing where we can improve.   Now on with the show...

### Legend

1. :thinking: - A "thinker" icon means that a little extra thinking may be required.
   Perhaps there are some choices to be made.
   Perhaps it's an optional step.
1. :pencil2: - A "pencil" icon means that the instructions may need modification before performing.
1. :warning: - A "warning" icon means that something tricky is happening, so pay attention.

## Expectations

- **Time:** Budget 40 minutes to get the demonstration up-and-running.
- **Background knowledge:** This repository assumes a working knowledge of:
  - [AWS Cloudformation](https://github.com/Senzing/knowledge-base/blob/master/WHATIS/aws-cloudformation.md)

#### Using deployment for cloudformation-senzing-basic

1. Visit [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
    1. Make sure correct AWS region is selected.
1. Wait until "senzing-basic" status is `CREATE_COMPLETE`.
    1. Senzing formation takes about 20 minutes to fully deploy.
    1. May have to hit the refresh button a few times to get updated information.
1. Click on "senzing-basic" stack.
1. Click on "Outputs" tab.
1. Open the "0penFirst" value in a new web browser tab or window.
    1. Because this uses a self-signed certificate, a warning will come up in your browser.  Simply continue.
    1. In the "Sign in with your email and password" dialog box, enter the *UserName* and *UserInitPassword*
       values seen in the "Output" tab of the "senzing-basic" stack.  This is a one-time password.
    1. In **Change Password**, enter a new password.

#### View cloudformation-senzing-basic

1. Visit [AWS Cloudformation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).

## Parameters

Technical information on AWS Cloudformation parameters can be seen at
[Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html).

### AcceptEula

1. **Synopsis:**
   To use the Senzing code, you must agree to the End User License Agreement (EULA).
   This step is intentionally tricky to ensure that you make a conscious effort to accept the EULA.
1. **Required:** Yes
1. **Type:** String
1. **Allowed values:** See [SENZING_ACCEPT_EULA](https://github.com/Senzing/knowledge-base/blob/master/lists/environment-variables.md#senzing_accept_eula).
1. **Default:** None
1. **Where used:**
    1. [cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation/blob/main/cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml)

### CidrInbound

1. **Synopsis:** A Classless Inter-Domain Routing
   ([CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing))
   value used to limit access to the system.
   This restricts the inbound traffic to requests from specified IP ranges.
   Examples:
    1. A system with the value `0.0.0.0/0` allows access from anywhere.
       Because of its "wide-open" nature, it is considered to be insecure.
    1. A system with the value `45.26.129.0/24` will allow access from IP addresses in the range `45.26.129.0` to `45.26.129.255`
    1. A system with the value `45.26.129.200/32` will allow access from a single IP address `45.26.129.200`.
1. **Required:** Yes
1. **Type:** String
1. **Allowed pattern:** Letters and numbers. Specifically: `'(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}(?:/\d\d?)?'`
1. **Allowed values:** String in IPv4 [CIDR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).
1. **Example:** 45.26.129.200/32
1. **Default:** None
1. **Where used:**
    1. [cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation/blob/main/cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml)

### CognitoAdminEmail

1. **Synopsis:**
   An email address of the person administrating this Cloudformation.
   The email address will be used when email is sent to additional users via the
   [AWS Cognito web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/users/#/pool/u).
1. **Required:** Yes
1. **Type:** String
1. **Allowed values:**
    1. A string in email format.
1. **Example:** `me@example.com`
1. **Default:** None
1. **Where used:**
    1. [cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation/blob/main/cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml)

### DatabaseStack

1. **Synopsis:**
   The name of the cloudformation stack deployed with the
   [aws-cloudformation-senzing-database-cluster](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-cloudformation-senzing-database-cluster)
   cloudformation template.
   The DatabaseStack exported output values are used by the
   [aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic).
1. **Required:** Yes
1. **Type:** String
1. **Example:** `senzing-db`

   Choose single database or Senzing database cluster.
   For increased performance and/or high volume, choose "Multiple".
   For lower cost, choose "Single".
   For more information see:
   <https://senzing.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010599254-Scaling-Out-Your-Database-With-Clustering>
1. **Required:** Yes
1. **Type:** Choice
1. **Allowed values:**
    1. "Multiple"
    2. "Single"
1. **Default:** Multiple
1. **Where used:**
    1. [cloudformation-senzing-database.yaml](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation/blob/main/cloudformation-senzing-database.yaml)

### SecurityResponsibility

1. **Synopsis:**
   The Senzing proof-of-concept AWS Cloudformation uses
   [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for authentication,
   and HTTPS (using a self-signed certificate) for encrypted network traffic
   to expose services through a single, internet-facing AWS Elastic Load Balancer.
   With exception of the
   [senzing/sshd](https://github.com/Senzing/docker-sshd) container,
   no tasks in the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) have public IP addresses.

   To enable additional security measures for the deployment in your specific environment,
   you'll need to consult with your AWS administrator.
   Examples of additional security measures:
    - [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) with genuine X.509 certificate
    - [AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/)
    - [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/)
    - [AWS Firewall Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager/)
    - [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
    - Restrictive value for [CidrInbound](#cidrinbound)
1. **Required:** Yes
1. **Type:** String
1. **Allowed values:**
    1. "I AGREE"
1. **Default:** None
1. **Where used:**
    1. [cloudformation-senzing-database.yaml](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation/blob/main/cloudformation-senzing-database.yaml)
    1. [cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml](https://github.com/Senzing/aws-marketplace-evaluation/blob/main/cloudformation-senzing-basic.yaml)

### SenzingLicenseAsBase64

1. **Synopsis:**
   To ingest more than 100,000 records, a Senzing license is required.
   A binary version of the Senzing license, `g2.lic`, is not usable as a parameter in the text entry field.
   Instead, a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) representation of the information is needed.
   An example of how to produce base64 from `g2.lic` on Linux and macOS:

   ```console
   base64 /opt/senzing/etc/g2.lic
   ```

   Copy the entire output from the command and paste into the text entry field.
1. **Required:** Yes if ingesting more than 100,000 records, otherwise no.
1. **Type:** String
1. **Allowed pattern:** Empty or Base64 characters. Specifically `^$|[^-A-Za-z0-9+/=]|=[^=]|={3,}$`
1. **Allowed values:** Base64 encoded string
1. **Example:**
